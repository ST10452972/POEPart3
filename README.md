When the `chatbotp3` application is launched, a visually styled WPF interface opens with a green ASCII art logo, a chat window,
a task assistant, and a quiz panel. A voice greeting plays to welcome the user, and the chatbot introduces itself with a message explaining its purpose. 

The user can begin interacting immediately by typing messages into the input field. The chatbot responds intelligently to questions about cybersecurity, 
offering helpful tips on topics like phishing, password safety, and privacy.
It also recognizes the user's name and interests, storing them for more personalized responses later in the session.

On the right-hand side, users can manage cybersecurity-related tasks by adding reminders such as “Enable 2FA,” which are stored and displayed in a list.
Additionally, the quiz panel offers an interactive cybersecurity quiz with multiple-choice and true/false questions, providing instant feedback and tracking the user’s score.
The chatbot logs each action (e.g., tasks added, quiz attempts, stored info) and can display a recent activity log on request. 
If a user inputs something unclear, the bot replies with a default message asking for rephrasing, maintaining a smooth and supportive interaction throughout the session.
